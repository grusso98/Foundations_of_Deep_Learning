## Pill Quality Control 
Image classification and augmentation using traditional techniques and Generative Adversarial Neural Networks.
* The first objective of this project is to perform classification on pills, specifically trying to detect if in a quality control scenario is possibile to detect pills with cosmetics defects like chips or dirt. This task has been carried out training CNNs from scratch and comparing them with pre-trained nets.
* The second objective is to remedy for the lack of training data using generative adversarial neural networks (GANs), combined with traditional data augmentation.

## Files
* Code_Pill notebooks contains all the code used for this project, from CNN to GANs.
* The pdf is the presentation of the project.
